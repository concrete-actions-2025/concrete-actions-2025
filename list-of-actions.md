## Donate to (international) health and education nonprofits 
The Health Secretary et al are running a massive disinformation campaign [1] [2] and defunding the Centre for Disease Control and the National Institutes for Health [3] [4] at the same time as multiple ongoing and future threats to public health [5][6]. Loss of federal funding is also disrupting the work of nonprofits, both within the US and globally, that distribute medicines, run vaccination and nutrition programs [7] [8]. Donating money now should not be seen as a case for permanent philanthropic (rather than government) funding of these projects but to act as a stopgap while they are battling it out in the courts. Inspired by this post, some options: 

- Rapid Response Fund
- Foreign Aid Bridge Fund
- Gavi

## Support independent press
- Support AP Journalism
- American Journalism Project
- Institute for Nonprofit News
- Find Your News

## Volunteering
- Voter registration drives, phonebanking, voter education (e.g. Fair Fight, League of Women Voters, Voto Latino, and more). Check in with neighbors, friends, students and other first-time voters. These include conversations about how to register, why their vote matters, information about candidates, and how elections generally work.
- Constitutional literacy: TeachDemocracy, ACLU Know your Rights, NILC resources, SPL center resources,
- Combating misinformation: FactCheck.org, MediaMatters, News Literacy Project, CCDH

## Exercise Your Free Speech!

## Can we (American / otherwise) really effect change?
- Yes: [1], [2], [3]
- The power of incremental change:
"...one-third of respondents reported spending at least two hours a day reading, discussing and thinking about political news [without taking action]. Too many of us misunderstand what politics is: 'It’s about working in groups to turn one vote into more than one vote, one voice into more than one voice, by getting others on board with you.’”
- Courage is contagious.
